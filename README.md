# code-breaking-games-optimal-solver
An even faster C++ classical Mastermind game optimal solver that uses a highly optimized recursive DFS algorithm to find the strategy with the lowest possible average number of moves (4.34028). Code can also be easily customized for different combinations of code breaking games other than 4 digits of 6 colors [4,6]
